2. I got confused by what algorithms did, so I believed that algorithms could do anything, just that it may take a lot of storage. However, now I know that there are some problems that algorithms can't solve.

6. I got A correct as an answer, but C incorrect. I think I just got confused doing this problem. The issue is that the alogirthm would stop as x hit 20 and wouldn't display 20. The right answer was D, where x gets to 21.

17. I got this completely wrong with both options because I believed that if there were numbers after the minimum number, the algorithm wouldn't work. The issue was in fact when the minimum number is the last number. So the answers were C and D.

18. This one I just had completely no idea how to do. The one I chose did work correctly, displaying a false. The right answer was c, where it got to one and displayed true when there was still a negative number.
