2. I chose C because I thought the issue was with the if statements. The actualy answer was replace line 9 with else, as this would cause x to be increased 75% of the time and y 25% of the time.

4. I didn't read the remainder part for choice b, so I thought that would ocme out as a decimal which would be too many digits for one bit. But, it is the answer because remainders can only be 1 or 0 and that can be represented by a bit.

15. I got confused with the wording of the answer. I knew that the values were going to be differen, but I just chose the wrong answer. The right answer was that the number of values was the same but the values were different.

36. I knew that the file was broken down for transmission, but I didn't know how packets were received. The right answer was that the packets have to be reassembled once received.
