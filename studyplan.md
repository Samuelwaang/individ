### Study Plan:

- do the practice tests and make corrections, then redo these incorrect ones by myself at the end of the week to make sure I understand them

- go over previous quizzes we have done throughout the year and make sure I understand the questions

- go over video notes I've taken

### Reflection:

I got 48/50 on both quizzes, so I did pretty well on both. But, there are still some things I need to review. Mostly, I have to review terms that I didn't know. For everything else, I did pretty well. By going over the practice tests, I was able to fix my mistakes and make sure I get them right the next time.
