1. The creative commons license basically means that you don't have copyright over it and allows anyone to use it. This makes sense for our project because we don't care that much about people looking at our code or using it. An MIT license allows people to use the code however they'd like and allow them to make and send out closed-source stuff using this code. GPL License allow people to use the code however they'd like, but doesn't allow them to send out closed-source stuff using this code.

2. The license I chose was creative commons, so if people want they can access and use the code. The stuff we are doing aren't really for personal gain, so it doesn't matter much if other people can use the code. ([License Link](https://github.com/Samuelwaang/individ/blob/add-license-1/LICENSE))

1. Some of the PII we have done in our websites in CSP is the about me page(s). We put our names, pictures, and hobbies on that page, allowing anyone to be able to access and see this information.
2. It's quite important to keep private information off the internet most of the time. I think with social media profiles, as long as you don't say too much, it's not big deal. I feel like my exposure is fine, as I haven't divulged any really private info.
3. Good passwords are ones that use many different types of characters, are long but memorable, and don't relate to you (ie: your name). Bad passwords are exactly the opposite, with examples such as password and 12345. Another step in authentication is 2FA, which is used by many now, so that even if someone who shouldn't has your password, you can still prevent these people from accessing your account.
4. Symmetric encryption is when only one key is used for both decryption and encryption, while asymmetric uses two keys (one private, one public) to do encryption/decryption.
5. SSL uses asymmetric and symmetric encryption.
6. I once clicked a link while I was playing a game. This allowed the other person to pull my ip. Another way of a phishing scam is the scammer making a site that looks identical to the legit site and getting the user to input all of their information.
